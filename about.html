        <h1>What is the app about and how it works</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This app is created to help orphanages by letting them know if you have any stuff to donate.
            Once you come across the first page you have to identify yourself either as a donor or a orphanage.
            If you are a donor you can click on the option and it will take you to a page where it asks your
            username and pincode. The Pincode acts like a room name and after you give it it will take you to a
            screen where you can chat with orphanges near or in your pincode cause they will also be asked
            to give thier pincode.
        </p>
